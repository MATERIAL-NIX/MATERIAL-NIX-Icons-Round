<b>(*NixRound)</b> Material Design inspired Icon theme for Linux from the [Material*Nix project](https://github.com/MATERIAL-NIX). This readme provides information on installation, icon requests and hardcoded icons. Licensed under the GPL-3.0+

### Installation
##### Building from Source

You can build and install the Material*Nix icon theme from source:

### Icon Requests
When filing an icon request or reporting a missing icon, please take care in providing the following useful information: 

 - A screenshot of your issue or an image of the original icon you are requesting to be themed
 - The file name for the missing icon or the requested icon, for example `gimp.png` or `system-shutdown.svg`
 - A short description of the application or software that you are requesting an icon for.

 - For Chrome apps just post a link to the webstore page. 

##### Note
When filing your request please be respectful, patient, and remember that development is done solely by myself.

### Hardcoded Icons
Note: some software ships hardcoded icons, meaning when you install icons are not placed in the system-wide directory `/usr/share/icons` which makes them unthemeable.

To deal with hardcoded application icons Material*Nix uses the [hardcode-fixer](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer) script. A list of the applications supported by the script can be found [here](https://github.com/Foggalong/hardcode-fixer/wiki/App-Support).

### Credits
Theme inspired By and aiming to adhere to Google's Material Design product icon [guidlines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/icons.html#).

Icons are designed and developed by Adam Harley
