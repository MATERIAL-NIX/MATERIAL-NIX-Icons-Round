This work is licenced under the terms of version 3 of the GNU General Public License (GPLv3).

Nobody should be restricted by the software they use. There are four freedoms that every user should have:

	* the freedom to use the software for any purpose,
	* the freedom to change the software to suit your needs,
	* the freedom to share the software with your friends and neighbors, and
	* the freedom to share the changes you make.
	
When a program offers users all of these freedoms, we call it free software.

Developers who write software can release it under the terms of the GNU GPL.
When they do, it will be free software and stay free software, no matter who changes or distributes the program.
We call this copyleft: the software is copyrighted,
but instead of using those rights to restrict users like proprietary software does, 
we use them to ensure that every user has freedom.
